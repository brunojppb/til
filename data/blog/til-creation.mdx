Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the first entry on my TIL website. This is mostly a blog for my future self where I can
throw together things I learned during my day-to-day which I find interesting. I realized that I'm
constantly learning something, but I either forget about it or I write it down somewhere and it's
hard to find. Hopefully this public space will be a bit easier for my future self to find.

To save some time and not to have to come up with the entire website boilerplate, I've used this
cool template called [TailwindBlog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
that is based on NextJS and Tailwind. It looks cool, it's mobile friendly and let me write markdown.
Perfect combo.

And while you are still around, I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bpaulino0) if would like
to follow me. And my main website is available [here](https://bpaulino.com).
