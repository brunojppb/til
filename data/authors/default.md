I am originally from Brazil and currently based in Vienna, Austria. I am a passionate Software
Engineer who loves crafting solutions that can help ease our lives and make it more fun.

I am mainly interested in Web development and programming languages these days. I have been writing
web applications using Scala, Elixir, JavaScript and TypeScript.

This is a spin-off of my [main website](https://bpaulino.com) where I throw together interesting
stuff I learn during my day.
